# boilerplate

This is a list of tools I may want to use with new projects.

There is (will be) a script to ask which tools to use and auto install
std packages and config files where it can.

Some installs will have to be manual, but over time this should make
bring new projects online simpler.

Also it saves me having to remember how to set up various config
files and I have an example of the latest and greatest for each.
